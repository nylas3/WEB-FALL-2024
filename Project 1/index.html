        <h2>Personal Summary</h2>
        <p>I remember I bought this book on my Fourteenth Birthday(February 3rd, 2018). I just happened to come across it at a Barnes and Noble. It was one of two books that I bought(the other was Ready Player One). To me, this book was a fun way to engage with lessons about life. Ever since my first read through over 6.5 years ago, I have committed to doing a read of the book each year. As I keep doiing this, some of the jokes that did not land or mean much to me in previous years have become a bit more relevant to where I am at in life. I would reccomend this book to everyone I know and it will always be the answer to when someone asks me what my favorite book is.</p>

                <h3>Joke 1: Back to The Front</h3>
                <p>It was the morning of Black Friday, and there was a big sale at the electronics superstore. People had started waiting in line at 5:00 a.m. At about 7:30, there was a huge commotion when a short guy in khaki pants tried working his way to the front of the line. He didn't get very far before the mob grabbed him, wrestled him out of line, and threw him into the parking lot. The little guy got back up, brushed himself off, and tried again. He was barely able to take another step before an even bigger mob attacked him and threw him out of the line again. Undeterred, the guy got up and started limping toward the line a third time. "Are you nuts?" asked one of the red-faced mob members. "Don't you know you're just gonna get tossed out of line again?" "Yeah, I know," the little guy replied. "But if you don't let me get to the front of the line, no one's going to open the store."

                <h3>Joke 2: Leave Me A Loan</h3>
                <p>A wealthy woman goes into a New York City bank to ask for a loan. She tells the loan officer that she's going on vacation and needs to borrow $5,000. "Well," says the banker, "do you have anything you can use as collateral?" "Yes, I do," the woman replies. "T'll use my Rolls-Royce." "You mean you want to put up a $250,000 Rolls-Royce as collateral for a $5,000 loan?" asks the stunned banker. The woman nods and hands over the keys. The loan officer can't believe she's for real, so he has an associate check her credentials to make sure she's the legitimate owner. Sure enough, everything checks out, so the banker parks the luxury car in the bank's underground garage and writes her a check for $5,000. Two weeks later the woman comes back from vacation and immediately goes to the bank, where she pays off the $5,000 loan- along with $15.41 in interest. The loan officer takes the money, and as he's handing her the keys, he says, "Miss, we're glad to have your business, but we're puzzled. We did some research and found out you're a multimillionaire. So why would you need to borrow $5,000?" The woman smiles and replies, "Where else in New York City could I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?"</p>

                    An old guy is driving home from work when his wife calls him on his cell phone. "Phil," she shouts in a panic, "Please be careful!

                <h3>Joke 4: Don't Ask</h3>
                <p>A woman walks up to an old man sitting in a rocking chair on his porch. "Excuse me," she says. "You look so happy. If you don't mind my asking, what's your secret for a long and happy life?" "Well," the man replies, "every day I smoke two packs of cigarettes, drink a pint of whiskey, eat a dozen doughnuts and a bag of potato chips, and I never exercise." "Wow! That's incredible," she says. "Exactly how old are you?" "Twenty-six."

                <h3>Joke 5: Take the Money and Run</h3>
                <p>
                    A barber is talking to one of his customers. "See that kid?" he says as he points to a twelve-year-old standing outside the barbershop. "He is the dumbest kid in the world. Watch. I'll prove it to you." The barber takes out a one-dollar bill and a five-dollar bill, and then calls the boy inside. He holds out both bills, and asks, "Which one do you want, son?" The kid takes the one-dollar bill and leaves the shop. "See?" laughs the barber. "The dumbest kid in the world." A few minutes after the customer leaves the barbershop, he happens to see the boy coming out of an ice cream store. He goes over and asks, "If you don't mind my asking, son, why didn’t you take the five-dollar bill?" The boy takes a lick of his ice cream cone and replies, "Because the day I choose the five-dollar bill, the game's over."</p>

                <h3>Joke 6: Personal Pain</h3>
                <p>A husband and wife go into a dentist's office. The husband makes it clear to the dentist that he's in a hurry. "I need to have a tooth pulled, but I don't want any expensive extras, Doctor —no gas or novocaine. Just pull the tooth and let's get this over with as quickly as possible." "Wow," said the dentist. "I wish more patients were as brave as you. Now, which tooth is it?" The husband turns to his wife and says, "Open your mouth and show him, honey."

                <p>Out at sea, a young deckhand named Charlie drank alcohol for the first time in his life, and he got pretty sloppy. The next day, he saw that in the ship's official log, the captain had entered: "Charlie was drunk today." Charlie went to the captain and asked him to make an additional entry noting that it was his first time drinking. "Otherwise," he explained, "it looks like this is a common occurrence for me, which it definitely is not!" "That's too bad," said the captain, "but the entry was truthful, and therefore it will not be changed." A few days later, when it was Charlie's job to write the log, he entered, "The captain was sober today."

                <h3>Joke 8: Love Actually</h3>
                <p>A bride and groom were blissfully in love and couldn't wait to begin their life together. She loved to ride horses, so they went to a Montana dude ranch for their honeymoon. One day, they decided to go out for a ride. As the horses crossed a small stream, the man's horse slipped and jostled him. When they reached the stream bank, the woman dismounted, walked over to his horse, and staring into its eyes, said, "That's one!" Then she remounted and they continued their ride. A little farther along the path, the husband's horse stumbled while stepping over a fallen tree. The woman got down and, pointing her finger in the horse's face said, "That's two!" She returned to her saddle and they moved on. Later that afternoon, the man's horse got spooked by a snake in the path and reared back on its hind legs, throwing the man onto the ground. The woman quickly dismounted, stepped in front of her husband's horse, and shouted, "That's three!" Then she pulled a pistol out of her pocket and shot the horse dead. The man, shocked at seeing the horse killed, said to his wife, "You maniac! How could you do such a thing?" The woman walked over to her husband, and, staring calmly into his eyes, said, "That's one."</p>

                <h3>Joke 9: The Perfect Martini</h3>
                <p>A wealthy man goes into a New York City bar that's famous for its world-class cocktails and says to the bartender, "I'd like the world's best martini." "Well, sir," the bartender replies. "I can make you the world's best martini, but it's going to take a lot of time... and it's going to cost you a lot of money." "Money is no object," says the man. So the bartender takes the man into the back room, opens a safe, and removes bottles containing the worlds rarest gin and the world's rarest vermouth. The man reaches for the bottles and the bartender says, "Patience, sir. Now we must go to Italy." "Italy?" asks the man. "Yes, Italy," replies the bartender. So they fly to Florence and then drive to a remote Tuscan hillside where they find the worlds most prized olive tree. Now well wait until the olives are perfectly ripe"So they sit down and wait... and wait... and wait Days later the  bartender picks two perfect olives and seals them in a hyperbaric chamber. "When do I get my martini?" asks the man. "Patience, sir," says the bartender. "For the final step, we must go to San Francisco." "San Francisco?" asks the man. "Yes," replies the bartender. So they fly to San Francisco and then take a taxi to a hotel in the Mission District, where they get a luxury suite with a full kitchen so the bartender can finally make the martini. "Almost done, sir. We have the perfect gin, the perfect vermouth, and the perfect olives. But the real secret is in how one blends the ingredients. So we must wait again." "Wait?" the man asks. "For what?" "An earthquake.".</p>

                <h3>Joke 10: Don't Just Do It</h3>
                <p>A group of first-year medical students was in an anatomy class —their first with a real, dead human body. They all gathered around the dissection table as the professor stood by the cadaver-which was covered with a white sheet-and lectured them. "In the practice of medicine, you must have two important qualities. The first is this: Never be disgusted by anything involving the human body." To make his point, the professor drew back the sheet, stuck a finger in the corpse's butt, pulled it out, and then sucked his finger. "Now you do it," he told them. Stunned, the students hesitated at first. But eventually each one 
                    walked up to the body, stuck a finger in the butt, and sucked on it. When everyone was done, the professor looked at them and said, "The second important quality you need is to be observant. I stuck in my middle finger and sucked on my index finger. Now, learn to pay attention."</p>
