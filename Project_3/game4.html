    <h3>The Story of Game 4 in Quotes from AP</h3>
    <p><i class="GSW">Business as usual,</i> Curry said. <i class="GSW">We answered the bell. We got back to who we are as a team.</i></p>
    <p><i class="CLE">Let's get one,</i> James said. <i class="CLE">We've already got to take a flight home anyways, so we might as well come home with a win and play on our home floor again.</i></p>
    <p><i class="GSW">He's Stephen Curry,</i> coach Steve Kerr said. <i class="GSW">He's the MVP for a reason. He doesn't have the size and strength to dominate a game physically, so he has to dominate with his skill, and that's not an easy thing to do because your shot sometimes isn't going to go in.</i></p>
    <p>"Draymmond exchanged words with James in the fourth quarter and appeared to hit Cleveland's superstar in the groin area. James believes the NBA will take a look at the play.
      Green, who kicked Oklahoma City's Steven Adams in the groin during the Western Conference finals, would be suspended for Game 5 if the league retroactively assesses a flagrant foul 1."</p>
