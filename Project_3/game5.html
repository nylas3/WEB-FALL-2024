    <h3>The Story of Game 5 in Quotes from AP</h3>
    <p><i class="GSW">We like our chances going forward and continuing to just try to be us, the best we can, and get one more win,</i> Curry said.</p>
    <p><i class="CLE">We had a mindset that we wanted to come here and just extend our period and have another opportunity to fight for another day,</i> James said. <i class="CLE">That was our main concern, and we were able to do that.</i></p>
    <p><i class="GSW">I kind of like our position</i> coach Steve Kerr said. <i class="GSW">I like our position a lot better than theirs.</i></p>
    <p>"Cleveland handed Golden State just its fourth defeat all season at sold-out Oracle Arena, denying MVP Stephen Curry and the Warriors a chance to celebrate another championship with their golden-clad "Strength In Numbers" supporters. Now, Curry & Co. must try to win on the road, just the way the Warriors did last year and in their only other championship season out west in 1975."</p>
