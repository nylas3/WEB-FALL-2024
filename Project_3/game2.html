    <h3>The Story of Game 2 in Quotes from AP</h3>
    <p><i class="GSW">There's no point in celebrating or jumping up and down saying, `Look at us.' We're two games away from winning a championship, but we still have to go out and get the job done,</i> Curry said. <i class="GSW">It's a trap to think that we've figured things out, that we have the perfect formula to beat Cleveland and they have no chance in the series. That's not how we're supposed to think.</i></p>
    <p><i class="CLE">They just beat us,</i> James said. <i class="CLE">We didn't win anything. No points of the game did we beat them in anything</i></p>
    <p><i class="GSW">I'm definitely surprised at the margin of victory tonight,</i> coach Steve Kerr said. <i class="GSW">It happens in the NBA, sometimes things get away from you. Sometimes shots go in, sometimes they don't. ... Everything changes when we go to Cleveland, we know that.</i></p>
    <p><i class="CLE">We've got to be tougher,</i> Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said.</p>
