    <h3>The Story of Game 1 in Quotes from AP</h3>
    <p><i class="GSW">You don't win championships without the entire squad coming in and making an impact on games,</i> Curry said. <i class="GSW">That's why we're here.</i></p>
    <p><i class="CLE">When you get outscored 45-10 on the bench and give up 25 points off 17 turnovers, no matter what someone does or doesn't do, it's going to be hard to win, especially on the road,</i> James said. <i class="CLE">Don't matter what you do with Steph and Klay, don't matter what you do with Draymond.</i></p>
    <p><i class="GSW">We play a lot of people, and we feel like we have a lot of talent on the bench that can come in and score when we need it,</i> coach Steve Kerr said. <i class="GSW">So it's a great sign, obviously, that we can win in the finals without those two guys having big games, but it's not really that surprising to us. This has been our team the last couple of years.</i></p>
    <p><i class="CLE">I thought our guys did a great job of locking into those guys,</i> Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. <i class="CLE">Their bench played well. So we've got to go back to the drawing board and try to figure out how to take those guys out of the game.</i></p>
