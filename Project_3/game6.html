    <h3>The Story of Game 6 in Quotes from AP</h3>
    <p><i class="GSW">I didn't think I fouled either Kyrie or LeBron,</i> Curry said. <i class="GSW"> It was obviously frustrating fouling out in the fourth quarter of a clinching game and not being out there with my teammates. So it got the best of me, but I'll be all right for the next game.</i></p>
    <p><i class="CLE">One more game left,</i> James said. <i class="CLE">I'll play it anywhere.</i></p>
    <p><i class="GSW">He gets six fouls called on him, three of them were absolutely ridiculous,</i> coach Steve Kerr said. <i class="GSW">As the MVP of the league, we're talking about these touch fouls in the NBA Finals. I'm happy he threw his mouthpiece.</i></p>
    <p><i class="CLE">It's LeBron being LeBron, </i>Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. <i class="CLE">He's one of the greatest of all-time. Our back was against the wall and he took it upon himself, him and Kyrie, they put us on their backs. They've got us to where we wanted to be -- and that's Game 7.</i></p>
    <p>"The Warriors never imagined being in this spot. The defending champions, who powered their way to a record 73 wins in the regular season, won the first two games by 48 combined points. But Curry and Co. have lost their touch, their poise and are in danger of seeing their historic season -- and a second title -- vanish."</p>
