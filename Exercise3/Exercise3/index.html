    <h2>
        Domain Naming by Chia Amisola
    </h2>
    <p>
        This text resonates deeply with the idea of websites being more than just digital spaces. They are manifestations of self, extensions of identity, and evolving landscapes of personal history. The concept of domain names being more than just practical identifiers but rather "invitations" to explore new dimensions of the self stood out to me. The line "I think of myself like I think of a website. At any moment, I am remaking my name and what it means" encapsulates how fluid identity can be in the digital age. It suggests a constant reinvention and remaking of the self, mirroring the malleability and impermanence of websites.
The text touches on the contrast between the idealism of the internet as a space for liberation and the reality of its imperialist and capitalist roots. This tension is powerfully captured in the line, "The internet can be traced to its imperialist U.S. roots, a military venture connecting scientists, the academe, and defense contractors." This reflection challenges the utopian myth of the internet being a neutral, boundless space. In fact, the mention of DNS governance and platform centralization reveals how the internet is deeply embedded in systems of power, even as it serves as a tool for personal expression.
The idea that naming a website is akin to "placemaking" also caught my attention. The statement "Naming then, is placemaking: as naming identifies a domain of control, it becomes the act of domaining itself" resonated because it ties language to spatial control, both online and in real life. It connects naming to identity, but also to power, suggesting that the act of naming on the internet reflects broader social and political dynamics.
As I reflect on the question of whether websites will become obsolete, I find myself agreeing with the idea that websites are extensions of identity, so as long as we continue to evolve, the need for personal, self-contained spaces on the internet will remain. However, as the text suggests, these spaces will also continue to contend with the forces of platform centralization, capitalism, and power.

            <h2>
            My Website is a Shifting House Next to a River
of Knowledge. What Could Yours Be? by Laurel Schwulst
            </h2>
    <p>
        This essay by Laurel Schwulst, originally published on The Creative Independent, reflects on the nature and potential of websites in our current digital age. Schwulst, who teaches interactive design and internet courses, begins by addressing a question she often receives from students: "How do I actually make a website?" Despite teaching them the technical aspects of web creation, Schwulst believes their question stems from a deeper uncertainty about navigating today’s complex web landscape dominated by corporate social media.
The essay explores the changing purpose and possibilities of websites, emphasizing their inherent duality as both objects and experiences. Schwulst presents a range of metaphors to express the varied ways a website can exist: as a room, a shelf, a plant, a garden, a puddle, or even a rock tossed into the ocean. These metaphors reflect how websites can be spaces of creativity, identity formation, and even ephemeral existence.
Schwulst argues that, in a web largely controlled by major corporations, individuals, particularly artists, have the power to shape the internet's future. Websites, she suggests, offer an alternative to social media’s commercialized environment by allowing people to construct personal, meaningful spaces that can evolve over time.
Ultimately, Schwulst calls for a return to the internet’s original ethos of interconnected individual nodes, advocating for a more mindful, creative approach to website creation that aligns with personal growth and societal betterment. The essay challenged me to rethink the role of websites in my life and to embrace their potential as living, dynamic spaces for expression and connection.

        <h2>
        A Handmade Web by J.R. Carpenter
        </h2>
        <p>
            J.R. Carpenter’s reflection on the "handmade web" serves as both an homage to an era of the internet characterized by individual creativity and a critique of the commercial and algorithm-driven web of today. The handmade web, much like handcrafted objects, speaks to an authenticity and individuality that challenges the seamless, often opaque nature of modern digital experiences. Carpenter draws parallels between handmade web pages and artisanal physical materials, such as zines and pamphlets, emphasizing the manual labor and personal touch that characterized early internet culture.
A key theme in the essay is the tension between the amateur, DIY ethos of the mid-1990s web and the corporate dominance of today's web landscape. By hand-coding web pages, individuals had control not just over the content, but also over the medium through which it was presented. This enabled a kind of self-expression that was slow, small, and intimate. This is contrasted with modern web platforms, where users are often consumers of content rather than creators, and where the means of creation are obscured behind proprietary software and platforms.
Carpenter's observation about the relationship between physical labor and digital creation is particularly poignant. Just as zines required manual effort, the handmade web required the coder’s direct engagement with the material of the web itself—its HTML, its links, its structure. The web of today, in contrast, is often experienced passively, with handheld devices further distancing users from the underlying mechanics of digital spaces.
By evoking the "handmade web," Carpenter is advocating for a return to that active engagement with the digital environment—a call to resist the commodified, controlled web by continuing to handcraft, self-publish, and experiment with web art. I belive that this advocacy for "slowness and smallness" resonates as a form of resistance in a world where speed, efficiency, and scale are often prioritized at the expense of individuality, creativity, and personal ownership.
