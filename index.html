            Hello, my name is Nylas Burgess and I am a Senior at Fordham College at Lincoln Center(FCLC). I am studying New Media and Digital Design and History while on the Pre-Law Track. Originally, I grew up in Harlem, NY but I currently commute to school from Hackensack, NJ. On campus, I am the President of our Commuting Students Association at Lincoln Center(CSA). I have also been VP for our Black Student Allaince and an Orientation Captain. A fun fact about myself is that none of my top three favorite sports teams are based in New York.
